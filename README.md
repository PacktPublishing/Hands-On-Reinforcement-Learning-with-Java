# Hands-On Reinforcement Learning with Java [Video]
This is the code repository for [Hands-On Reinforcement Learning with Java [Video]](https://www.packtpub.com/data/hands-on-reinforcement-learning-with-java-video), published by [Packt](https://www.packtpub.com/?utm_source=github). It contains all the supporting project files necessary to work through the video course from start to finish.
## About the Video Course
There are problems in data science and the ML world that cannot be solved with supervised or unsupervised learning. When the standard ML engineer's toolkit is not enough, there is a new approach you can learn and use: reinforcement learning.

This course focuses on key reinforcement learning techniques and algorithms in the Java ecosystem. Each section covers RL concepts and solves real-world problems. You will learn to solve challenging problems such as creating bots, decision-making, random cliff walking, and more. Then you will also cover deep reinforcement learning and learn how you can add a deep neural network with DeepLearning4J in your RL algorithm.

By the end of this course, you'll be ready to tackle reinforcement learning problems and leverage the most powerful Java DL libraries to create your reinforcement learning algorithms.
